> – UHD Academic Honor Code


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You are submitting this exam under the UHD honor code. Answer all below questions. Complete the questions, knit the file to html, commit and push to your repository *BEFORE 2:45* and turn in link to the repository to Blackboard. __Any commit made after 2:45 pm will not be graded.__ 

\newpage 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```




### Part 1 (20 points)

* You will get 10 points of credit for a properly knit RMD/html(or pdf) file.
* You will get 10 points of credit for a properly committed and pushed GitHub repository, with clear and descriptive commit descriptions. 

## Part 2 (10 points)

In your own words, *briefly* describe the difference between saving, committing, and pushing.

Saving the file will save the file to your local drive (if not saved: red text in the editor tab)

Commiting the file will save your commit locally; in this part you add a commit message that explains what changes you made. 

Pushing your file will send it to the cloud. It will then be available in the website(github)

## Part 3 (10 points)

* [2 points] Create a vector named `numbers` that contains the odd numbers from 3 to 15. 

* [3 points] Create a second vector called `half_numbers` that contains the elements of `numbers` divided by 2

* [2 points] Add the string "puppies" to the end of `numbers`. 

* [3 points] Try to divide the new vector by two. Does it work? Why or why not? 

```{r}
numbers <- 3:15
half_numbers <- numbers/2
c(numbers,"puppies")
#c(numbers,"puppies")/2
print("It doesn't work, because non-numeric argument to binary operator")
```

## Part 4 (15 points)

You run a small dog daycare. This is the data you have on the dogs that come to your business.

```{r}
names <- c("Fido", "Doug", "Bella", "Max", "Cooper", "Lucy", "Duke", "Barkley")
age <- c(2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 13, 9, 3)
weight <- c(14, 89, 32, 46, 55, 7, 25, 36)

#[2 points] Find the average weight and age of the dogs.
x <- mean(age)
x
#[2 points] How light is the dog with the lowest weight?
y<-min(age)
y
#[3 points] What is the name of the oldest dog?
names[which.max(age)]
#[3 points] What is the age of the heaviest dog?
age[which.max(weight)]
#[2 points] It's been 2 years since you entered this information! Change `age` to reflect that. 
age <- age + 2
age
#[3 points] A new dog is here! Her name is Daisy, she is 3 years old, and weighs 39 pounds. Add her to your data. 
names <- c(names, "Daisy")
age <- c(age, 3)
weight <- c(weight,39)
names
age
weight
```

## Part 5 (10 points)

In baseball, the slugging percentage is computed with 5 variables, the number of singles, doubles, triples, homeruns and at-bats. We abbreviate these 1B, 2B, 3B, HR and AB. 

1. [7 points] Write a function that takes these 5 values as arguments and returns the slugging percentage for that player. 

$$  \frac{(1B + 2B\times2 + 3B \times 3 + HR\times 4)}{AB} $$
```{r}
slugging_perc <- function(B1,B2,B3,HR,AB)
{
  fun_value <- (B1+(B2 * 2) + (B3*3) + (HR * 4))/AB
  return(fun_value)
}

```
2. [3 points] The Astros player Jose Altuve currently has the following stats: 

`1B = 89, 2B = 34, 3B = 0, HR = 25, AB = 499 `

Use your function to find his slugging percentage. 

```{r}
slugging_perc(89,34,0,25,499)
```


## Part 6 (15 points)

1. [6 points] Write a function that takes a vector `x` and returns a vector with the square root of each element of the vector. 

> For example, if you pass the function a vector containing 4 and 16, it should return a vector containing 2 and 4. 

```{r}
sqrt_Func <- function(x)
{
  y <- sqrt(x)
  return(y)
}
x <- c(4,16)
sqrt_Func(x)
```


2. [6 points] Write a second function that does the above, but also removes any negative values or changes them to 0.

> For example, if you pass *this* function -4 and 16, it should return either 0 and 4 or just 4.

```{r}
no_negatives_sqrt <- function(x)
{
  x[x<0]<- 0
 return(sqrt_Func(x))
}
p <- c(-4,16)
no_negatives_sqrt(p)

```

3. [3 points] Test your second function on the following vectors:

```{r}
test1 <- c(1:10)
test2 <- c(-4:4)
no_negatives_sqrt(test1)
no_negatives_sqrt(test2)
```


## Part 7 (10+3 points)

A fancy tech company gives employees ratings of 1, 2 and 3, which are used to compute their annual bonuses. If an employee gets a score of 3, their bonus is 15% of their salary, if they get a 2, their bonus is 10% of their salary, if they get a 1, their bonus is 5% of their salary. 

Rating | Bonus Percent
:-----:|:-----:
3|15%
2|10%
1|5%

1. [8 points] Write a function that takes the employees score and their salary as arguments and returns their bonus amount for the year. 
```{r}
bonus_amount <- function(x)
{
  
  if(x[1]==3)
  {
    return(x[2] * 0.15)
  }
  else if(x[1]==2)
  {
    return(x[2]* 0.10)
  }
  else
  {
    return(x[2]*0.05)
  }
}
```
2. [2 points] Fitz makes $100,000 a year, but only got a score of 1. Use your function to calculate his bonus.
```{r}
score <- c(1,100000)
bonus_amount(score)
```

3. [3 extra credit points] Modify your function so that it returns the full pay for the year, salary and bonus combined. How much will Fitz make in total?
```{r}
modified_bonus <- function(x)
{
  y <- bonus_amount(x)
  return( y + x[2])
}
score <- c(1,100000)
modified_bonus(score)
```
